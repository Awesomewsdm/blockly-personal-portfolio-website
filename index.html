    <p>
      Hey there! I'm a CSE student with a diverse range of passions that revolve around coding, graphic design. These two elements make up the core of my identity and bring a unique blend of creativity and technical skills to my work. First and foremost, coding is my true passion. I love delving into the intricacies of programming languages and algorithms, using them as tools to bring my ideas to life. It's a way for me to express my creativity and push the boundaries of what is possible. But my interests don't stop there. I also have a keen eye for graphic design. The ability to merge aesthetics with functionality is something that truly excites me. From creating visually stunning user interfaces to crafting captivating graphics, I strive to enhance the user experience through my designs. It's incredibly fulfilling to see how well-designed visuals can elevate a project to a whole new level.
